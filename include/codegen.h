   in setupSymbolTables, which is declared in symtbl.h.

   This method writes NASM code for the whole program to the
   specified outputFile (which must be open and ready for writes
   before calling generateDISM).

   This method assumes that setupSymbolTables(), declared in
   symtbl.h, and typecheckProgram(), declared in typecheck.h,
   have already executed.
